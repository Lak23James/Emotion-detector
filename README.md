# VisionQuest: Facial Emotion Recognition 🎭


## 📌 Overview
**VisionQuest** is a Computer Vision application designed to recognize human emotions from facial images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with **PyTorch**, the model processes images and classifies them into one of seven universal emotions.

This project explores the end-to-end pipeline of a Deep Learning project: from data preprocessing and augmentation to model training, evaluation, and real-time inference.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To build a robust CNN architecture capable of feature extraction from facial images.
- To handle class imbalances in emotion datasets (e.g., distinguishing 'Fear' vs 'Surprise').
- To implement detailed evaluation metrics (F1-Score, Confusion Matrix) beyond simple accuracy.

## 🧠 Model & Dataset
**The Emotions:**
The model is trained to recognize the following classes:
1. Angry 😡
2. Disgust 🤢
3. Fear 😱
4. Happy 😀
5. Neutral 😐
6. Sad 😢
7. Surprise 😲

**Tech Stack:**
* **Core:** Python 3.10
* **Deep Learning:** PyTorch, Torchvision
* **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Metrics:** Scikit-Learn
